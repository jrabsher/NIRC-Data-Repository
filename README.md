# NIRC-Data-Repository
This project involves several steps that are getting underway at this time:
1.  Obtaining consent from the IRB for the project
2.  Identifying subjects and having them sign informed consent
3.  Pulling data from the EPIC EHR for these subjects
4.  Deidentifying these data and including a unique identifying code in their EPIC chart
5.  Pulling brain images from the local clinical imaging data repository
6.  Identifying these images with the unique identifier for each subject
7.  Adding the data directory containing these images as another data element in the database of EPIC data for each subject
8.  Processing the brain images to extract information on a regional/structural basis
9.  Creating searches and exploratory anlyses to test hypotheses about the correlations between the clinical and imaging data
10. Running prospective studies to verify the findings derived through these exploratory analyses
